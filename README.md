# Code samples

Hi there!
This repository will be filled with some code I've written in the last years.
The majority of the code comes from academic exercises, some HackerRank exercises also, some code jam, etc.
(!) This is just a test repository, please, if you come here (by accident I hope), and if it's here some code, consider it GPL'd, you can look, download, modify, etc.
